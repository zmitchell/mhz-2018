# Femtosecond TRCD Control Program

This is the program that controls the femtosecond time-resolved circular dichroism spectroscopy experiment in the lab of Prof. Sergei Savikhin at Purdue University. Unless you work in that lab, there is very little to be gained from using this code, as it is written in a proprietary scripting language I'm positive you don't have access to.
